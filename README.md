# nyquist412layout

This is a very simple project, consisting of only one code file. This code is
used to specify the keymap for my custom built Nyquist/Levinson 4x12 Ortholinear
split keyboard, designed by [Keebio](https://keeb.io/). This project has the
JSON output from the [QMK Configurator](https://config.qmk.fm), as well as a nice PDF printout that
shows the layout graphically. Feel free to reuse and modify if you think it's a
good starting point for your adventures with [QMK](https://qmk.fm/).
